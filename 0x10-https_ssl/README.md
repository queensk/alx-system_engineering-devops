# 0x10. HTTPS SSL

## What is HTTPS?

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a version of the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) that includes a security component. HTTPS encrypts the communication between a web server and a web client, such as a browser, to protect against eavesdropping and tampering.

When a user connects to a website using HTTPS, the website's server and the user's browser establish a secure, encrypted connection using a protocol called SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security). This encryption ensures that any data exchanged between the server and the client, such as login credentials, credit card information, or personal data, cannot be intercepted and read by a third party.

One way to tell if a website is using HTTPS is to look at the URL in the address bar of your browser. If it starts with "https://" instead of "http://," that means the website is using HTTPS. Additionally, many browsers will display a lock icon in the address bar to indicate that a website is using HTTPS.

In summary, HTTPS is a protocol used to secure web communication, it encrypts the data exchanged between the website's server and the client's browser to protect against eavesdropping and tampering.

## Main elements that SSL is providing

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the predecessor of TLS (Transport Layer Security) which provides two main elements of security for online communications:

Authentication: SSL/TLS verifies that the website the user is connecting to is the legitimate website and not an imposter. This is accomplished by the website providing a digital certificate, which is verified by a trusted third-party certificate authority.

Encryption: SSL/TLS encrypts the communication between the user's browser and the website's server, making sure that any data exchanged between them, such as login credentials, credit card information, or personal data, cannot be intercepted and read by a third party.

## HAProxy SSL

HAProxy is a popular open-source load balancer and reverse proxy that can be used to terminate SSL connections

- Install the haproxy

```
sudo apt-get -y install haproxy
```

- verify that HAProxy is working:

```
haproxy -v
```

- respond with:

```
HA-Proxy version 1.6.3 2015/12/25

```

HAProxy main configuration file is located at `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`

default settings /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg file has

```

```

Global section contains settings that apply to the HAProxy process itself. This section contains user, group, log directives, and stats.
Defaults section contains all of the proxies settings.

Restart the haproxy service after editing `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`

## Load Balancing HAProxy

At the bottom of the /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg add

- frontend: Defines a reverse proxy which will listen for incoming requests on a specific IP address and port.
- backend: Defines a pool of servers that the frontend will forward requests to.
- listen: A shorthand notation which combines frontend and backend features into a single command.

add the fronted to the `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`

```
frontend firstbalance
        bind *:80
        option forwardfor
        default_backend webservers
```

The bind gets an ip and using the \* accepts all ips
The option will save the users ip by using the `forwardfor` options
Default_backend directive, to forward requests to a pool of servers defined in a backend section called webservers. We can distribute the load across many servers.

add the `backend` after the frontend

```
backend webservers
        balance roundrobin
        server webserver1 Your-Webserver1-IP:80 check
        server webserver2 Your-Webserver2-IP:80 check
        option httpchk
```

Traffic is routed using the roundrobin algorithm by default.
Traffic can be resolved debending on user location using access control lists acl directive in the frontend section.
`leastconn` algorithm is a good choice for servers that may hold on to connections longer.
Health checking by adding the check parameter to the webserver1 and webserver2 servers directive.

Health check with check parameter measures the ability to make a tcp connection. A drawback of enabling health checks with the check parameter is that success is measured only by the ability to make a TCP connection to the back-end servers IP address and port. So, even if the web servers begins responding with HTTP 500 Internal Server Error, the checks will still pass as long as a connection can be made. So, visitors might be sent to web pages that are displaying errors.

This can be fixed by checking for a successful http response in the range of 2xx-3xx is good. Added the option httpchk directive to the back-end to enable this heath check

## TLS termination proxy

A TLS termination proxy is a device or service that sits in front of one or more servers, intercepts incoming HTTPS traffic, and then establishes a new HTTPS connection to the backend servers on behalf of the client. The proxy decrypts the incoming traffic and then re-encrypts it before forwarding it to the backend servers. This allows the backend servers to communicate with clients over plain HTTP, while still providing encryption and authentication for the client-server communication.

TLS termination proxies are commonly used in load balancing and reverse proxy scenarios, where a single IP address is used to represent multiple servers and the load balancer or reverse proxy needs to decrypt the incoming traffic in order to route it to the appropriate server.

There are different software that can be used as a TLS termination proxy, such as HAProxy, Nginx, Apache, etc. The process of setting up a TLS termination proxy using those software are similar with some changes in the configuration file.

# [LetsEncrypt with HAProxy](https://serversforhackers.com/c/letsencrypt-with-haproxy)

## Install LetsEncrypt

```
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y certbot
```

## HAProxy Setup

```
#The frontend only listens on port 80
# If it detects a LetsEncrypt request, is uses the LE backend
# Else it goes to the default backend for the web servers
frontend fe-scalinglaravel
    bind *:80

    # Test URI to see if its a letsencrypt request
    acl letsencrypt-acl path_beg /.well-known/acme-challenge/
    use_backend letsencrypt-backend if letsencrypt-acl

    default_backend be-scalinglaravel

# LE Backend
backend letsencrypt-backend
    server letsencrypt 127.0.0.1:8888

# Normal (default) Backend
# for web app servers
backend be-scalinglaravel
    # Config omitted here
```

## New Certificates

```
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d demo.scalinglaravel.com \
    --non-interactive --agree-tos --email admin@example.com \
    --http-01-port=8888
```

Lets roll through what this does:

1. --standalone - Create a stand-alone web server to listen for the cert authorization HTTP request
2. -d demo.scalinglaravel.com - The domain we're creating a cert for. You can use multiple -d flags for multiple domains for a single certificate. The domain(s) must route to the server we're creating a cert for (DNS must be setup for the domain).
3. --non-interactive --agree-tos --email admin@example.com - Make this non-interactive by saying as much, agreeing to the TOS, and informing LetsEncrypt of the email to use to send "YOUR CERT IS EXPIRING" notifications.
4. --http-01-port=8888 - The Magicâ„¢. This tells the stand-alone server to listen on port 8888. Note that LetsEncrypt will still send the authorization HTTP request over port 80. However the listener is expecting a proxy (such as our HAProxy server) to route the request to it over port 8888. The flag is http-01 because it expects an HTTP request, NOT an HTTPS request.

## Renewing Certificates

If we are renewing a certificate, that likely means that there's a valid HTTPS certificate in use. We just need LetsEncrypt to do the same process as above to renew it. However, there's a few key differences:

HAProxy is presumably listening on port 443 for SSL connections, and LetsEncrypt is going to send an authorization request over HTTPS instead of HTTP.
The stand-alone server will expect an HTTPS (TLS, technically) request into it instead of a plain HTTP request.
So, the HAProxy setup will be almost the same, except this time it will be listening on port 443.

> We'll cover setting up the HAProxy configuration for SSL in a bit.

```
frontend fe-scalinglaravel
    bind *:80

    # This is our new config that listens on port 443 for SSL connections
    bind *:443 ssl crt /etc/ssl/demo.scalinglaravel.com/demo.scalinglaravel.com.pem

    # New line to test URI to see if its a letsencrypt request
    acl letsencrypt-acl path_beg /.well-known/acme-challenge/
    use_backend letsencrypt-backend if letsencrypt-acl

    default_backend be-scalinglaravel

# LE Backend
backend letsencrypt-backend
    server letsencrypt 127.0.0.1:8888

# Normal (default) Backend
# for web app servers
backend be-scalinglaravel
    # Config omitted here
```

Here's how to renew a certificate with LetsEncrypt:

```
sudo certbot renew --tls-sni-01-port=8888
```

## SSL Certificates and HAProxy

sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssl/demo.scalinglaravel.com

```
sudo cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/demo.scalinglaravel.com/fullchain.pem \
 /etc/letsencrypt/live/demo.scalinglaravel.com/privkey.pem \
 | sudo tee /etc/ssl/demo.scalinglaravel.com/demo.scalinglaravel.com.pem
```

The HAProxy configuration, as we saw, uses that new file:

```
frontend fe-scalinglaravel
    bind *:80

    # This is our new config that listens on port 443 for SSL connections
    bind *:443 ssl crt /etc/ssl/demo.scalinglaravel.com/demo.scalinglaravel.com.pem

    # omitting the rest of the config...
```

# Automating Renewal

We can start by editing the CRON file to run a script monthly:
To open the CRON service on a Unix-like system like Ubuntu, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```
sudo crontab -e

```

We can start by editing the CRON file to run a script monthly:

```
0 0 1 \* \* root bash /opt/update-certs.sh
```

The bash file referenced in the CRON task (/opt/update-certs.sh) looks like this:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Renew the certificate
certbot renew --force-renewal --tls-sni-01-port=8888

# Concatenate new cert files, with less output (avoiding the use tee and its output to stdout)
bash -c "cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/demo.scalinglaravel.com/fullchain.pem /etc/letsencrypt/live/demo.scalinglaravel.com/privkey.pem > /etc/ssl/demo.scalinglaravel.com/demo.scalinglaravel.com.pem"

# Reload  HAProxy
service haproxy reload
```

Enforcing HTTPS

```
frontend fe-scalinglaravel
    bind *:80
    bind *:443 ssl crt /etc/ssl/demo.scalinglaravel.com/demo.scalinglaravel.com.pem

    # Redirect if HTTPS is *not* used
    redirect scheme https code 301 if !{ ssl_fc }

    acl letsencrypt-acl path_beg /.well-known/acme-challenge/
    use_backend letsencrypt-backend if letsencrypt-acl

    default_backend be-scalinglaravel
```
